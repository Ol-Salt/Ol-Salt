# About Me ðŸ‘‹

**Ol-Salt/Ol-Salt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning SwiftUI to create apps for use in land based Aquaculture.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SwiftUI through Kodeco
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help from people who can discuss Swift and GitHub without being too technical.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: emailseancorrigan@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: When not doing marine work I am an award winning wildlife woodcarver.
